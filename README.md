# Alzheimer-Detection

This project aims to develop an Alzheimer's disease detection model using deep learning. Unlike existing algorithms with approximately 91% accuracy, our model achieves an accuracy ranging from 93% to 94%.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a robust model for Alzheimer's disease detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is stored in Google Drive. It consists of images categorized into different classes, each representing a specific class related to Alzheimer's disease.

## Project Structure

- `Data Exploration`: Randomly displays images from the dataset for visual inspection.
- `Model Training`: Constructs and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Alzheimer's disease detection.
- `Model Evaluation`: Evaluates the model on a validation set and prints accuracy and loss metrics.
- `Results Visualization`: Plots the training history to visualize the model's performance over epochs.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- pandas
- Google Colab (for execution in a Colab environment)

- Future Work
Continued research and improvement can further enhance the model's accuracy and generalization. Potential areas for exploration include:

Hyperparameter tuning
Transfer learning with pre-trained models
Larger and more diverse datasets
Feel free to contribute to the project or use the code as a foundation for your own Alzheimer's disease detection models.
